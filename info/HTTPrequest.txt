An HTTP request is the tool used by a client to tell a server what it wants.

It has 3 parts:

- Request line
- Headers
- Body

The request line has 3 components:
- Method
- Request-URI
- HTTP-Version

The 3 components are separated by a " " and the line ends with "\r\n".
The syntax is: 
"<Method SP> <Request-URI> <HTTP-Version> \r\n"
